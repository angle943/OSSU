WHY SEMANTICS AND IDIOMS

This couoruse focuses as much as it can on semanticcs and idioms

- Correct reasoning about programs, interfaces, and compilers
  requires a precise knowledge of semantics
-- Not "I feel that conditional expressions might work like this"
-- Not "I like curly braces more than parentheses"
-- Much of software development is designing precise
   interfaces; what a PL means is a really good example

- Idioms make you a better programmer
-- Best to see in multiple settings, including where they shine
-- See Java in a clearer light even if I never show you Java
