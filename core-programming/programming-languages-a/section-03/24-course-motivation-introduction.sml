COURSE MOTIVATION

Why learn the funcamental concepts that appear in all (most?) languages?

Why use languages quite different from C, C++, Java, Python?

Why focus on functional programming?

Why use ML, Racket, and Ruby in particular?



CAVEATS

Will give some of my reasons in terms of this course

- My reasons: more personal opinion than normal lectures
-- Others may have qually valid reasons

- Partial list: surely other good reasons

- In terms of course: Keep discussion informal
-- Not rigorous proof that all reasons are correct

- Will not say one language is "better" than another
-- May omit "your fav language" without malice



SUMMARY

- No such thing as a "best" Programming language

- Fundamental concepts easier to teach in some (multiple) PLs

- A good PL is a relevant, elegant interface for writing software
-- There is no substitute for precise understanding of PL semantics

- Functional languages have been on the leading edge for decades
-- Ideas have been absorbed by the mainstream, but very slowly
-- First-class functions and avoiding mutation increasingly essential
-- Meanwhile, use the ideas to be a better C/Java/PHP hacker

- Many great alternatives to ML, Racket, and Ruby, but each was chosen for a reason
 and how they complement each other
