ARE ALL LANGUAGES THE SAME?

Yes:
- Any input-output behavior impelentable in language X is
  Implementable in language Y [Church-Turing thesis]
- Java, ML, and a language with one loop and three infintely large integers are "the same"

Yes:
- Same fundamentals reappear: variables, abstraction, on-of types, recursive definitions

No:
- The human condition vs. different cultures
- The primitive/default in one language is awkward in another
- Beware "the Turing tarpit"
