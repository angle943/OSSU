(Most of) the full definition

The semantics for pattern-matching takes a pattern p and a value v and decides (1) does it match and
(2) if so, what variable bindings are introduced.

Since patterns can nest, the definition is elegantly recursive, with a separate rule
for each kind of pattern. Some of the rules:
- If p is a variable x, the match succeeds and x is bound to v
- If p is _, the match succeeds and no bindings are introduced
- If p is (p1,...,pn) and v is (v1,...,vn) the match succeeds if and only if
p1 matches to v1,...,pn matches vn. The bindings are the union of all bindings from the submatches
- If p is C p1, the match succeeds if v is C v1 (ie the same constructor) and p1 matches v1.
The bindings are the bindings from the submatch
- ...there are several other similar forms of patterns

 examples:

 - Pattern a::b::c::d matches all lists with >= 3 elements

 - pattern a::b::c::[] matches all lists with 3 elements

 - pattern ((a,b),(c,d))::e matches all non-empty lists of pairs of pairs
