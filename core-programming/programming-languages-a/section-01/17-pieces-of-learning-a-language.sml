(* 

Five different things:

1. Syntax: How do you write language constructs?

2. Semantics: What do programs mean? (Evaluation rules)

3. Idioms: What are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation?

4. Libraries: What facilities does the language (or a well-known project) provide "standard"?
 (eg file access, data structures)

5. Tools: What do language implementations provide to make your job easier?
 (eg REPL, debugger, code formatter, ...)
 - Not actually part of the language

 These are 5 separate issues
 - in practice, all are essential for good programmers
 - many people confuse them, but shouldn't
