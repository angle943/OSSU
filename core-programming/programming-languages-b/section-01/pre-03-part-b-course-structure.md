# Part B: Three Weeks

- because we have done Part A and Racket installation is easy, acn "jump right in"
- First two weeks: same structure to homeworks: auto-grader, peer review, ...
- Third week: A quiz (10% of grade) on just that section
- Weeks 2 and 3 used to be combined, so now each is shorter, but:
  - Homework 5 (week 2) is considered by many to be much more challenging (and rewarding)
- an exam at the end of part c covers part B and part C
