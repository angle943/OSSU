1. Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence The man saw the woman with a telescope, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman has the telescope.

- The man saw the woman by looking through the telescope.
- The man saw the woman that has the telescope.

2. For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:

   (a) Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway

    - Sisters who have been stranded for ten years have reunited in a checkout line at Safeway.

   (b) Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.

    - City authorities are investigating the root cause of the large hole that has appeared in High Street.

   (c) Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.

    - Mayor says that people who ride in the bus should wear belts while riding.

3. The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room:
   `No head injury is too trivial to ignore.`
   Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong
   that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

- All head injuries are too serious to ignore

4. You often see the following notice posted in elevators:
   `In case of fire, do not use elevator.`
   This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended
   second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)

- When there is a fire, don't use the elevator
- In case there is a fire, don't the elevator.
- It should be: Don't use the elevator when there is a fire.

5. Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the bottom:
   This page intentionally left blank.
   Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement? What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again, the context means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no problem. But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth century destroyed one prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in an entire branch of mathematics.)

- This page is intentionally left blank except this sentence.

6. Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is (clearly) not what the writer intended. [This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is very common.]

- Nah

7. Comment on the sentence “The temperature is hot today.” You hear people say things like this all the time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in mathematics would be disastrous.

- Temperature is a measurement. It should be "The temperature is high today outside, making outside hotter than usual."

8. (2*3*5*7*11*13) + 1
