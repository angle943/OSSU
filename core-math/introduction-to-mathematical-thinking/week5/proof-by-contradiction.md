# Proof by Contradiction

1. You want to prove some statement P.
2. You start by assuming ¬P
3. You reason until you reach a conclusion that is false
4. A true assumption cannot lead to a false conclusion
5. Hence the assumption ¬P must be false
6. In other words, P must be true.

Proof by contradiction is a good way to prove that something does not exist.
